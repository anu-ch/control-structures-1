The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

#program

print("Enter the number of Months:")
n=int(input())
n=n-2
a=0
b=1
for i in range(1,n+1,1):
    c=a+b
    a=b
    b=c
print("The amoeba size is",c)
